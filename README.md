# Short-term-Load-Forecasting-using-Model-Tree
A regression tree is a very simple and effective way to predict the future based on historical data. Model tree [1] is the improved version of original regression tree algorithm [2] which can handle missing data and continuous attribute. In this paper, model tree (R5P) technique has been applied as a forecasting tool to generate seven days hourly and daily electric load forecast using real data of an American power distribution company. The forecasting result found from R5P has been compared with most popular forecasting technique linear regression (LR).
